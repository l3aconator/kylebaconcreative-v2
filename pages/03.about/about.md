            description: 'A design is arbitrary and can become useless if proper research isn’t carried out. Everything I do starts with research to develop a basis for my rationale: mood boards, user stories/walkthroughs, business comparisons and profiles, and the like. This is always step one of my process.'

            description: 'Pencil to pixel. Physical to digital. Whatever the final execution is, this is where I manipulate and design it. I explore with tools, processes, and designs until I find the best solutions. Design, code, illustration, strategy, etc.: all happen in this stage.'
