title: 'MisterWives Gig Poster'

metadata:
    description: 'MisterWives is a relatively new entrant into the pop genre and seemed to have started a storm. I love their music and was inspired to illustrate a gig poster for a university project when their debut album—Our Own House—came out. I was inspired by the band’s creation, which was out of the lead’s singer want for an 80s cover band at her birthday party. I derived the color palette from that decade of music. Even further, the band’s name is a flip on the Mormon term “Sister Wives.” I highlighted the flip on their name through marriage symbolism stuck in a man’s body, turning him into an object of desire.'
